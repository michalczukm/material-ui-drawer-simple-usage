# How to use material-ui <Drawer /> component?

## Did you read <Drawer /> example usage?

It is available on [https://material-ui.com/components/drawers/](https://material-ui.com/components/drawers/) and it is f..... overcomplicated!

So... I cleaned it a little bit and created a simplesc case scenario for you in `App.js`.

## Run it project

This project is based on Create React App.

* Run `npm ci` to install dependencies
* Run `npm run` to run it

## Dependencies

Please remember about adding `@material-ui/core` dependency to your project if you'd like to use `<Drawer />` - run `npm i @material-ui/core`.
